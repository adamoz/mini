A manuscript containing results was published in Scientific Reports in November 2020. Participants with anxiety from life-threatening illnesses were randomized to receive MDMA (125 mg MDMA HCl) or placebo in combination with two eight-hour therapy sessions. At the primary endpoint, the MDMA group had a greater mean (SD) reduction in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Trait scores, -23.5 (SD:12.3), indicating less anxiety, compared to the placebo group, -8.8 (SD:14.7); however, the group difference was not statistically significant [90].\\n\\n6.3.4 Alcohol Use Disorder\\n\\nAn investigator-initiated trial investigated the safety and tolerability proof-of-concept of MDMA- assisted therapy for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) post-detoxification in an open-label study [645]. Participants with AUD (N=14), post-detoxification, completed a ten-session course of recovery-based therapy over eight weeks that included two sessions where participants received an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA HCl followed by a supplementary dose of 62.5 mg MDMA HCl in combination with eight-hour therapy sessions.

At treatment exit (the end of Stage 1 or 2, final assessment), CAPS-IV severity scores dropped 44.8 points (SD 2.82), Cohen’s d effect size of 1.58 [33]. Symptom severity remained essentially the same as treatment exit when assessed at least 12 months later, with scores dropping 5.2 more points, indicating an enduring reduction in symptoms after MDMA-assisted therapy (Figure 4). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to long-term follow-up (67.0%) [33]. However, the lack of a control group at 12-month follow-up limited the interpretation of these results and warrants further investigation.\n",

      "MAPS completed a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (MAPP1) in 2020 demonstrating the efficacy and safety of MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment of PTSD [30]. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site study, participants with severe PTSD were treated using divided doses of 80 mg to 180 mg MDMA HCl. Therapy in conjunction with MDMA was statistically superior for PTSD treatment as measured by a decrease in CAPS-5 severity scores from Baseline to 2 months after three blinded dosing sessions in comparison to therapy paired with an inactive placebo. These findings are supported by the sponsor’s earlier Phase 2 clinical trials to develop the medical use of MDMA-assisted therapy for patients with chronic PTSD [31]. Large placebo- subtracted effect sizes, indications of efficacy in a Phase 3 trial, and favorable safety outcomes led to the approval of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD as a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA in 2017 for expedited drug development [32]. A long-term follow-up of participants at least 12 months later found a low relapse rate and that benefits outweighed risks associated with treatment [33].\n",

The supplemental dose and dose escalation could be withheld if the initial dose was not tolerated or the participant declined.

Despite slight differences in study designs, including length of time post second dosing session to outcome assessment (3 to 8 weeks), and language of the CAPS (English or translated), these results demonstrate reproducibility and generalizability across multiple international studies of MDMA-assisted therapy in the treatment of chronic PTSD. Placebo and comparator groups cross over to Stage 2 after the Primary Endpoint; therefore, CAPS was not administered at the End of Stage 1 for these groups. Active dose groups (100 mg and 125 mg MDMA HCl) do not crossover, hence no data for Stage 2 endpoints.\n",

      "Initial human studies from the 1990s focused on physiological effects of MDMA from a safety perspective, and current investigations have examined the effects on attention, prosocial effects, memory and brain activity, and human drug discrimination. Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Hallucinogenic subjective effects were not actively assessed during therapy sessions, as was done in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers [12, 15, 16, 667].

Reported effects of MDMA include enhanced feelings of closeness to others, well-being, and insightfulness [54-56]. MDMA was used in the 1970s and 1980s to enhance therapy for individuals, couples, and groups to treat various psychological disorders, including moderate depression and anxiety [55, 57-59]. It was also found to be useful in reducing physical pain secondary to certain kinds of cancer [58]. No formal controlled clinical trials of safety and efficacy were conducted at the time [55, 60].\n",

      "Safety data from studies in controlled research settings and clinical trials show that MDMA produces sympathomimetic effects that include statistically significant, self-limiting increases in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure that are likely to be transient and well tolerated by healthy individuals [11, 13-15, 36-42, 78, 79, 232, 549] and patients with PTSD and other indications in which MDMA-assisted therapy has been studied. Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

When assessed in terms of willingness to choose money over receiving the drug, participants previously experienced with Ecstasy provided similar responses to 2 mg/kg MDMA HCl and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a sign of having reinforcing effects [633].

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1.

      "Initial human studies from the 1990s focused on physiological effects of MDMA from a safety perspective, and current investigations have examined the effects on attention, prosocial effects, memory and brain activity, and human drug discrimination. Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Hallucinogenic subjective effects were not actively assessed during therapy sessions, as was done in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers [12, 15, 16, 667].

Reported effects of MDMA include enhanced feelings of closeness to others, well-being, and insightfulness [54-56]. MDMA was used in the 1970s and 1980s to enhance therapy for individuals, couples, and groups to treat various psychological disorders, including moderate depression and anxiety [55, 57-59]. It was also found to be useful in reducing physical pain secondary to certain kinds of cancer [58]. No formal controlled clinical trials of safety and efficacy were conducted at the time [55, 60].\n",

      "Safety data from studies in controlled research settings and clinical trials show that MDMA produces sympathomimetic effects that include statistically significant, self-limiting increases in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure that are likely to be transient and well tolerated by healthy individuals [11, 13-15, 36-42, 78, 79, 232, 549] and patients with PTSD and other indications in which MDMA-assisted therapy has been studied. Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

When assessed in terms of willingness to choose money over receiving the drug, participants previously experienced with Ecstasy provided similar responses to 2 mg/kg MDMA HCl and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a sign of having reinforcing effects [633].

      "Initial human studies from the 1990s focused on physiological effects of MDMA from a safety perspective, and current investigations have examined the effects on attention, prosocial effects, memory and brain activity, and human drug discrimination. Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Hallucinogenic subjective effects were not actively assessed during therapy sessions, as was done in Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers [12, 15, 16, 667].

Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials.

The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Based on the reports, 24 reactions were identified to be tracked during sponsor-supported studies MP-1 and MP-2, and three were added after examining data from the first sponsor-supported study in a PTSD sample (MP-1). The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening.

The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

In the active MDMA dose groups, participants reported spontaneously reported reactions including dry mouth, diarrhea, heavy legs, impaired judgment, and nystagmus; none were reported as severe and all had resolved by day 7 following the dosing session. The most frequently reported severe reactions in these Phase 2 studies were anxiety, nausea, insomnia, and tight jaw (see Table 10-13 and Appendix Tables 17-21).

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials.

The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Based on the reports, 24 reactions were identified to be tracked during sponsor-supported studies MP-1 and MP-2, and three were added after examining data from the first sponsor-supported study in a PTSD sample (MP-1). The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

Using univariable analysis, after adjusting for dose per body weight, the study reported participants with higher scores on the personality trait “openness to experience,” predicted more perceived “closeness,” a stronger decrease in “general inactivation,” and higher scores in feelings of “oceanic boundlessness” and “visionary restructuralization”, while participants with higher scores on the personality trait “neuroticism” or “trait anxiety” were more likely to have unpleasant or anxious reactions.

Findings from an initial sponsor- funded study indicated that MDMA-assisted therapy could be conducted safely in people with chronic PTSD who had failed first line treatments [78]. This was demonstrated in a chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD sample in a sponsored placebo-controlled study (MP-1) [79], which demonstrated durable improvement in PTSD severity. In this study, MDMA had no deleterious effects on cognitive function or safety pharmacology laboratory results when given on two occasions, spaced 1 month apart. In addition, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials confirmed that the active doses of MDMA produce an easily controlled state characterized by euphoria, increased well-being, sociability, self-confidence, extroversion, transient increases in anxiety, and minor alterations in perception [12, 14-16, 80-84].\n",

Studies have shown that pretreatment with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), can enhance the subjective effects of MDMA in humans. On the other hand, pretreatment with ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, can reduce the psychological and physiological effects of MDMA. Reboxetine, a norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, has been found to reduce the stimulant effects of MDMA in humans. Sex differences have also been observed in the effects of MDMA, with females showing a greater increase in plasma copeptin levels compared to males. Additionally, studies have shown that acute effects of LSD, MDMA, and D-amphetamine differ in healthy subjects. Haloperidol pretreatment has been found to reduce the psychological effects of MDMA in humans. Finally, MDMA and methylphenidate have differential effects on social cognition.

People receiving active doses of MDMA defined as 75 to 125 mg MDMA HCl, experience euphoria, positive mood, vigor, and positively experienced derealization, consonant with early retrospective reports, but also report experiencing anxiety, tension, and dysphoria, as well as concern over losing control over the self [12, 14-16, 554] (see Table 32 and Table 33 for more details). There is evidence that increases in positive mood and anxiety increased with dose [12, 14, 80, 622]. Healthy controls reported greater interpersonal closeness to others [17, 80-83, 597]. It is uncertain whether the increases in positive and negative mood occurred simultaneously or at different times throughout the duration of MDMA effects; evidence from two different teams suggests that peaks in negative mood may precede peaks in positive mood [16, 604].\n",

Based on the reports, 24 reactions were identified to be tracked during sponsor-supported studies MP-1 and MP-2, and three were added after examining data from the first sponsor-supported study in a PTSD sample (MP-1). The investigators noted that participants in MP-1 reported greater incidence of diarrhea and muscle tightness, which were added to the list, and further observation led to the addition of impaired judgment. Based on the half-life of active MDMA doses being 7 to 9 hours, it was most important to collect reactions on the day of drug administration and the following 7 days after each dosing session. The subset of AEs referred to as spontaneously reported reactions included: anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, obsessive rumination, restlessness, irritability, headache, disturbance in attention, dizziness, parasthesia, judgment impaired, hypersomnia, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle tension, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, disturbed gait, dry mouth, thirst, sensation of heaviness, somnolence, and nystagmus.\n",

These results were repeated in a 2016 survey of 96 mothers who reported heavier Ecstasy use (1.3±1.4 tablets per week) during pregnancy. Infants had motor delays from 4 months to 2 years of age that were not attributable to other drug or lifestyle factors [654].

These events are relatively rare given the prevalence of Ecstasy use, estimated to be approximately 20 million worldwide. The most common adverse effects in Ecstasy and poly-drug use described in published case reports include hyperthermia, psychiatric problems, hepatotoxicity secondary to hyperthermia, and hyponatremia (see Section 4.3 Toxicology and Section 5.1 Serious Reports, Morbidity, and Mortality). Published reports examining emergency department admission after Ecstasy use cite anxiety and panic reactions as the most frequent reason for admission. Fatal dysrhythmias have been reported following heavy MDMA use, resulting in ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Individuals with underlying cardiac and/or pulmonary disease and preexisting conditions such as Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome are especially at risk for heart failure and fatal arrhythmias when using MDMA. Set and setting likely play a role in the development of some Ecstasy-related adverse reports, such as vigorous exercise, lack of attention to somatic cues, and too little or too much hydration combined with pharmacological action on AVP, resulting in hyperthermia or hyponatremia. Even if ambient temperature does less to moderate the effects of MDMA on body temperature in humans than originally believed based on animal studies, other environmental and behavioral factors, as those related to vigorous exercise, may be involved.\n",

      "Safety data from studies in controlled research settings and clinical trials show that MDMA produces sympathomimetic effects that include statistically significant, self-limiting increases in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure that are likely to be transient and well tolerated by healthy individuals [11, 13-15, 36-42, 78, 79, 232, 549] and patients with PTSD and other indications in which MDMA-assisted therapy has been studied. Risks posed by elevated blood pressure are addressed in clinical trials by excluding candidates with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or with pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension and by monitoring blood pressure and pulse during MDMA-assisted dosing sessions. The most common treatment- emergent adverse events more prevalent in the MDMA group from blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study data were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness postural, bruxism, nystagmus, blood pressure increased, feeling jittery, non-cardiac chest pain, dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, chills, substance use, micturition urgency, muscle twitching, somnolence, and nervousness. Common anxiety-related psychiatric symptoms were reported equally in both the MDMA and placebo arms in the Phase 3 trial. Reactions were transient and diminished as drug effects waned during treatment sessions and over a next 24-hour period. No increase in suicidality, cardiovascular, or abuse potential AESIs were observed in MDMA participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 3 study MAPP1. In studies conducted with and without sponsor support in controlled clinical settings, with individuals exposed to MDMA, there have been no published or reported unexpected SARs to date and expected SARs have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, one subject experienced an expected SAR (increased ventricular extrasystoles, reported in Study MP-8) in MAPS-sponsored clinical trials. SUSARS occur infrequently in the program and the sponsor is monitoring any SUSARs and once definitive information is available to determine if any SUSARs should be upgrade to SARs, the IB will be updated with this information.\n",

When assessed in terms of willingness to choose money over receiving the drug, participants previously experienced with Ecstasy provided similar responses to 2 mg/kg MDMA HCl and 20 mg d-amphetamine, a sign of having reinforcing effects [633]. A study that enrolled participants with a history of Ecstasy use (4 to 40 occasions) found that only self-reported feelings of playfulness were associated with participants’ desire to take MDMA in a controlled research setting [29].\n",

      "MDMA is responsible for a series of dose dependent physiological effects due to enhanced neurochemical release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and for indirect effects on hormone secretion, including oxytocin and AVP, which act on different target organs to modulate physiological functions in the body. MDMA is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions where an acute increase in blood pressure may pose a significant clinical concern, such as aneurysmal vascular disease (including thoracic and abdominal aorta, intracranial, and peripheral arterial vessels), arteriovenous malformation, or acute stroke or recent history of intracerebral hemorrhage and during or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). The elevation of blood pressure and increased heart rate produced by MDMA, like that produced by other sympathomimetic drugs, can lead to increased risk in people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n",
